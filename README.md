# codedepth

###### Generates scores for how many layers of local imports/exports are in a file

##### Supported Languages
- Python ðŸŸ¢
- Lua ðŸŸ¢
- JavaScript ðŸŸ¡ (Some styles of import statement may not be detected as a dependency)

## Dependencies

You will need Graphviz installed as an application - installation instructions can be found at https://graphviz.org/download/

## Quickstart

From the command line (this will use default parameters and output a ranked directional graph as a PDF):

```
> python -m codedepth <path of the target directory>
```
The PDF will be generated in the working directory.
If `<path of the target directory>` is omitted, the working directory will be used as the target.

In a python script:

```python
from codedepth import Scorer

scorer = Scorer(r"<path of the target directory>")  # Replace this path string with your own

# Calculates scores for all files in the target directory
scorer.parse_all()

"""
Generates a PDF saved in the working directory,
containing a ranked directional graph of the file dependencies for the target directory.
Once this is generated, it will be opened automatically.
Also generates and saves a file containing the DOT code required to create the graph
"""
scorer.plot_ranked()
```
